    "## 1) What is obejct oriented programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Object oriented Programming is a way of structuring your code in a way that both characteristics and behaviours of data can be bundled together into a single structure. This single structure then allows you to use the class or object your created again and again throughout your code, following the main coding principle of <b>Don't Repeat Yourself</b> (<b>DRY</b>). This allows you to create these objects throughout your code, allowing you access this information or perform certain functions after they have been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is in contrast to procedural programming which we have done so far, whereby you code follows a sequence of steps in order to complete a task using functions and code blocks which is the tradition in Data Science. You can see that here, and in previous workshops, as we use code blocks in our Jupyter notebook, and we have also learnt how to create functions as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of object oriented programming however is that this can allow you to store data and associated actions that you want to save and/or perform across multiple different entires while allowing you to use the base definition/blueprint again and again. This is useful when you know you have data that is structured in a way that you will store it with the same attributes, or there are overlapping attributes, and where you would want to have the same functionality associated with it. Most libraries that you will use throughout this workshop series will use some form of object oriented programming and you can take a look at their github repositories when you start using them to see how they organise their code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, an example of where object oriented programming may be useful is thecase of a firm where you have multiple employees and you want to store their work information (of course with their permission). For each employee you would want to store information such as: current wage, years worked for the firm, current grade, all of which are associated with the company and how they manage their employees, while you may also want to store other information such as their age or their birthday. With this information, you may also want to add some degree of functionallity when an employee does something or where something happens. For example, you may want to give them a promotion that will increase their grade and also their pay, you may want to pay them a bonus, or they may learn a new skill such as new language. By creating an Employee class, you can store all this data and perform these functions with every employee in your firm, but you can reuse the same blueprint over and over again to ensure you have the same functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way this is done is by creating classes which are used as blueprints for objects. The class descrived overall what the object will but, but is seperate from the object itself which is a specific instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first task then is to create a class:"

    "## 2) Defining a class \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to do for this is to define a class.  This is a structure that describes essentially what the object will be and acts as a blueprint for creating specific objects in the future. As we've already emphasised, this can be used again and again to create multiple different objects that take the same structure, have the same attributes and perform the same functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are created using the keyword <b>class</b> and are followed by an indented block which contains methods (which are essentially the same as functions). An example of this would be as follows:"

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Here we have defined an employee class which takes pass as the only attribute currently. This means we have created an empty class which currently has no functionality embedded in it. This is important as it is the only way to create an empty class as you can't leave the code black, otherwise you will get an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note here that to create a new class we have used the form `class <name>` where `<name>` has taken the name of the class that we are creating. In this case, this is the <b>employee</b> class. Naming these classes takes on a certain convention known as [CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case#:~:text=Camel%20case%20(stylized%20as%20camelCase,word%20starting%20with%20either%20case.) which essentially means that instead of `_` seperating words (as in the case of snake case), the beginning of words are capitalised like we have with Employee here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing to note is that everything in the indented class has been specified will be part of the class. Since this is an empty class then nothing will be assigned to an instance of the class but we can run the following code to see what we can create an object of the class Employee:"

This is useful in many parts of programming and allows you to build on already existing functionality. An example of this would be that Geopandas (A library for manipulating geographical datasets) essentially inherits from Pandas, which allows Geopandas to use all the methods and attributes that Pandas has. This just means that it can build on Pandas without have reimplement itself all that pandas does, and that any changes to pandas can be integrated into future GeoPandas builds as well.\n",
