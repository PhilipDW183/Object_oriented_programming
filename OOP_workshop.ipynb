    "# Introduction to Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Object oriented Programming is a way of structuring your code in a way that both characteristics and behaviours are bundled together into a single structure, which allows you to use them again and again throughout your code. As such you can create new objects throughout your code to store data and perform functions. This is in contrast to procedural programming which follows a sequence of steps in order to complete a task using functions and code blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very useful when it comes to storing data that you want to also bundle associated actions with as it allows you to utilise the base definition again and again. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of this would be for a firm where you have multiple employees. For each employee you would want to store basic information such as: current wage, years worked for the firm, current grade and potentially their birthday. However, you may want to also add functions that allow you to change this information such as giving them a promotion, a wage increase or they leave the firm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way this is done is by creating classes which are used as blueprints for objects. The class descirbed overall what the object will be, but is seperate from the object itself. In essence the class is the objects "
